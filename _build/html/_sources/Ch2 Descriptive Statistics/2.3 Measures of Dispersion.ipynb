    "## The Standard Deviation ##\n",
    "An important characteristic of any set of data is the variation in the data. In some data sets, the data values are concentrated closely near the mean; in other data sets, the data values are more widely spread out from the mean. The most common measure of variation, or spread, is the standard deviation. The **standard deviation** is a number that measures the average distance of data values from their mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because distance is never a negative value, the standard deviation is always positive or zero. The standard deviation is small when the data are all concentrated close to the mean, exhibiting little variation or spread. The standard deviation is larger when the data values are more spread out from the mean, exhibiting more variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we are studying the amount of time customers wait in line at the checkout at supermarket A and supermarket B. the average wait time at both supermarkets is five minutes. At supermarket A, the standard deviation for the wait time is two minutes; at supermarket B the standard deviation for the wait time is four minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because supermarket B has a higher standard deviation, we know that there is more variation in the wait times at supermarket B. Overall, wait times at supermarket B are more spread out from the mean; wait times at supermarket A are more concentrated near the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A data value that is  more than two standard deviations from the average is considered by many statisticians to be an **outlier**—it deviates from the average much greater than the standard amount for the data. Considering data to be an outlier if it is more than two standard deviations away is more of an approximate \"rule of thumb\" than a rigid rule. In general, the shape of the distribution of the data affects how much of the data is further away than two standard deviations. (You will learn more about this in later chapters.)"

If $x$ is a data value, then the difference \"$x – \\text{mean}$\" is called its **deviation**; it's a measure of the distance from the value $x$ to the mean of the data. In a data set, there are as many deviations as there are items in the data set. The deviations are used to calculate the standard deviation. If the numbers belong to a population, in symbols a deviation is $x – \\mu$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose a population has mean $\\mu = 5$, and consider two data values of the population: $x = 2$ and $x = 8$. The deviation of the value $x = 2$ from the mean is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$x - \\mu = 2 - 5 = -3.$$ \n",

    "The deviation of the value $x = 8$ from the mean is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$x - \\mu = 8 - 5 = 3.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Both $x = 2$ and $x = 8$ are a distance of $3$ units away from $\\mu = 5$. But the signs (positives or negatives) of the deviations also tell us direction: since the deviation of $x = 2$ is $-3$, $x = 2$ is $3$ units *below* the mean; since the deviation of $x = 8$ is $+3$, $x = 8$ is $3$ units *above* the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "When calculating the standard deviation, we want to only focus on the average distance from the mean, not the direction. To remove the information on direction (the sign) from each deviation, we square each deviation. For $x = 2$, the squared deviation is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (x - \\mu)^2 = (2 - 5)^2 = (-3)^2 = 9. $$\n",

    "For $x = 8$, the squared deviation is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (x - \\mu)^2 = (8 - 5)^2 = 3^2 = 9. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since squaring a deviation always results in a positive number, it removes the information on direction. Unfortunately, squared deviations tell us the *square* of the distance of each value from the mean, not simply the distance. We will correct this problem later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we find the mean of all the squared deviations in the usual way: by adding up all the squared deviations in the population and dividing by the population size $N$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\sum(x - \\mu)^2}{N}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the average *squared* distance of the population data from the mean. We need to \"unsquare\" the average by taking the square root. This gives us the formula for the population standard deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum(x - \\mu)^2}{N}}.$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that to calculate the population standard deviation $\\sigma$, we first must calculate the population mean $\\mu$ since we use $\\mu$ in the formula for $\\sigma$. \n",

In a data set, there are as many deviations as there are items in the data set. The deviations are used to calculate the standard deviation. If the numbers belong to a population, in symbols a deviation is $x – \\mu$. For sample data, in symbols a deviation is $x – \\bar{x}$.\n",

The lower case letter $s$ represents the sample standard deviation and the Greek letter $\\sigma$ (sigma, lower case) represents the population standard deviation. If the sample has the same characteristics as the population, then $s$ should be a good estimate of $\\sigma$.\n",
