    "## Experiments, Outcomes, and Events\n",
    "Before we consider probability, we first must define a few key terms. To begin, it will be useful to focus on activities that can be repeated and where all the possible outcomes are known. These kinds of activities are called **experiments**. For example, flipping a fair coin is an experiment because it can be repeated (we can flip the coin again), and all the possible outcomes are known (the coin will land on either heads or tails). Another example of an experiment is drawing two cards from a standard 52 card deck because it can be repeated (we can return the two cards to the deck, shuffle, then take two new cards from the deck) and we know all the possible outcomes (since we know which cards are in the deck, we know all the cards that might be drawn).\n",
    "\n",
    "To be precise, we define an **outcome** of an experiment as a possible result of the experiment. Before an experiment takes place, there may be several possible outcomes that have a chance of happening. But after the experiment has concluded, exactly one outcome has happened. For example, if you toss a coin, the coin may come up heads or tails‚Äîtwo possible outcomes. But once the coin has landed, the coin has either come up heads or come up tails‚Äîexactly one outcome has actually occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **sample space** of an experiment is the **set** or collection of all possible outcomes. The uppercase letter $S$ is used to denote sample space. We can express the set of all possible outcomes using **set notation**: we list all the outcomes and enclose the list in curly brackets. For example, if you flip one fair coin, the sample space is $S = \\{H, T\\}$ where $H$ = Heads and $T$ = Tails are the outcomes. As another example, if you roll a six-sided die, the sample space is $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, where each number represents the side of the die that is face up.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **event** is any combination of outcomes. We usually use upper case letters like $A$ and $B$ to represent events, and we use set notation to represent the outcomes in the event. For example, if the experiment is to roll a six-sided die, then let event $A$ be rolling an even number, and let event $B$ be rolling a number greater than $2$. In set notation, $A = \\{2, 4, 6\\}$ and $B = \\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. If the experiment results in *any* outcome in the event, then the event has happened. And note that while an experiment can have only one outcome, it can result in multiple events happening. For example, if we roll a $4$ with a six-sided die, then event $A$ has happened (since $4$ is an even number), *and* event $B$ has happened (since $4$ is a number greater than $2$).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often useful to know how many outcomes are in an event. For any event $E$, we let $n(E)$ represent the number of outcomes in the event. Again, consider rolling a six-sided die, and let $D = \\{2, 3, 5, 6\\}$. There are four outcomes in event $D$, so $n(D) = 4$. Similarly, $n(S) = 6$ because $S$ is the entire sample space, and there are six possible outcomes total when rolling a six-sided die."

    "## Basic Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability** is a measure of how likely it is that some event occurs when an experiment is performed. For example, if we flip a fair coin, there is a $50\\%$ probability that the coin comes up heads and a $50\\%$ probability that the coin comes up tails. This means that the coin is equally as likely to come up heads as it is to come up tails. Probabilities are always between $0\\%$ and $100\\%$ because an event cannot have less than a $0\\%$ chance of happening or more than a $100\\%$ chance of happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is common to use percentages when speaking of probabilities, it is more convenient mathematically to express probabilities in decimal form. In decimal form, the probability that a flipped coin comes up heads is $0.5$ (since $0.5 = 50\\%$). Similarly, in decimal form, probabilities are always between $0$ and $1$. If a probability is in percentage form, it must first be converted to decimal form before it can be used in calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote the probability of an event $E$ as $P(E)$. For example, if we toss a fair coin and $H = $ the coin comes up heads, then $P(H) = 0.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of an event tells us how often we would expect the event to occur if we repeated an experiment many times. If $P(A) = 0.25$, then we expect event $A$ to happen in $25\\%$ of the experiments if we repeated the experiment many times. If $P(A) = 0.672$, then we expect event $A$ to happen in $67.2\\%$ of the experiments if we repeated the experiment many times. If $P(A) = 0$, then event $A$ will happen in $0\\%$ of the experiments; that is, event $A$ will never be the result of an experiment. If $P(A) = 1$, then event $A$ will happen in $100\\%$ of the experiments; that is, event $A$ will happen in every experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The more times you conduct an experiment, the more likely it is that the proportion of times an event occurs will be close to the probability of the event. For example, if we tossed a coin just two times, we wouldn't be too surprised if $100\\%$ of the tosses came up heads. If we tossed the coin five times, we'd be a little more surprised if $100\\%$ of the tosses came up heads. But if we toss a coin $1,000$ times, we would be *very* surprised if $100\\%$ of the tosses come up heads. With $1,000$ tosses, we expect the proportion of tosses that come up heads to be much closer to the probability of $0.5 = 50\\%$. (See {numref}`Figure {number} <observed-coin-flips>`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This important characteristic of probability experiments is known as the **law of large numbers** which states that as the number of repetitions of an experiment is increased, the proportion obtained in the experiments tends to become closer and closer to the theoretical probability. Even though the outcomes of the experiments do not happen according to any set pattern or order, overall, the long-term observed proportion will approach the theoretical probability."

    "A coin or die may be **unfair**, or **biased**. Two math professors in Europe had their statistics students test the Belgian one Euro coin and discovered that in 250 trials, a head was obtained 56% of the time and a tail was obtained 44% of the time. The data seem to show that the coin is not a fair coin; more repetitions would be helpful to draw a more accurate conclusion about such bias. Some dice may be biased. Look at the dice in a game you have at home; the spots on each face are usually small holes carved out and then painted to make the spots visible. Your dice may or may not be biased; it is possible that the outcomes may be affected by the slight weight differences due to the different numbers of holes in the faces. Gambling casinos make a lot of money depending on outcomes from rolling dice, so casino dice are made differently to eliminate bias. Casino dice have flat faces; the holes are completely filled with paint having the same density as the material that the dice are made out of so that each face is equally likely to occur. Later we will learn techniques to use to work with probabilities for events that are not equally likely.\n",

    "The **probability** of any outcome is the **long-term relative frequency** of that outcome. **Probabilities are between zero and one, inclusive** (that is, zero and one and all numbers between these values). $P(A) = 0$ means the event $A$ can never happen. $P(A) = 1$ means the event $A$ always happens. $P(A) = 0.5$ means the event $A$ is equally likely to occur or not to occur. For example, if you flip one fair coin repeatedly (from 20 to 2,000 to 20,000 times) the relative frequency of heads approaches 0.5 (the probability of heads).\n",

    "**Equally likely** means that each outcome of an experiment occurs with equal probability. For example, if you toss a **fair**, six-sided die, each face (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) is as likely to occur as any other face. If you toss a fair coin, a Head ($H$) and a Tail ($T$) are equally likely to occur. If you randomly guess the answer to a true/false question on an exam, you are equally likely to select a correct answer or an incorrect answer.\n",

If you were to roll the die only a few times, you would not be surprised if your observed results did not match the probability. If you were to roll the die a very large number of times, you would expect that, overall, $\\frac{2}{6}$ of the rolls would result in an outcome of \"at least five\". You would not expect exactly $\\frac{2}{6}$. The long-term relative frequency of obtaining this result would approach the theoretical probability of $\\frac{2}{6}$ as the number of repetitions grows larger and larger.\n",
